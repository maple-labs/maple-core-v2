## Overview

This repository contains the core smart contracts of the Maple V2 protocol.

## Setup

This project was built using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/). Refer to installation instructions [here](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation).

```sh
git clone git@github.com:maple-labs/maple-core-v2.git
cd maple-core-v2
forge install
```

## Usage

- To run all tests: `forge test`
- To run specific tests: `forge test --match <test_name>`

`./scripts/test.sh` is used to enable Foundry profile usage with the `-p` flag. Profiles are used to specify the number of fuzz runs.
